# npm-download-botter

A quick script I wrote to bot the amount of downloads on any npm package.

## Proof it Works

The way NPM calculates package downloads is by the amount requests which are served to the tarball url of your package.

Now you know why I made this script, something like that can so easily be abused and if you wished you could even do this on a larger scale with thousands of proxies requesting every second but I do not recommend this as it will put immense strain on NPM servers.
